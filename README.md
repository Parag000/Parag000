# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I‚Äôm Parag, an engineer fueled by curiosity and a relentless desire to create. Growing up, I often felt out of place in a traditional school environment, where my lack of interest in grades was overshadowed by my fascination with building and exploring. I spent countless hours dismantling toys, solving puzzles, and crafting intricate origami designs‚Äîactivities that didn‚Äôt earn me accolades but sparked a passion for understanding how things work.<br><br>Overtime I developed a passion for understanding algorithms and building machine learning applications transformed my perspective on learning. However, I faced my share of failures along the way‚Äîwhether it was grappling with communication barriers or realizing that being skilled at coding wasn‚Äôt enough to excel in engineering.<br><br>Motivated to improve my storytelling, I pursued a master‚Äôs degree in Data Analytics. This experience taught me that engineering is not just about programming; it‚Äôs about leading and inspiring others to turn ideas into reality.  To me, building isn‚Äôt just about code; it‚Äôs about curiosity, creativity, and making things that matter.

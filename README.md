# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm Parag, an engineer who‚Äôs never quite fit into the traditional mold. Growing up in Bangalore, I wasn‚Äôt the best student, and school didn‚Äôt exactly capture my interest. My real education happened at home, dismantling toys to understand motors, losing myself in hours of origami, and constructing rock stacks and card towers. I wasn‚Äôt driven by grades or fitting in‚ÄîI was driven by the thrill of building things, even if no one else understood why.

My passion for building led me to earn a degree in AI & ML, where I discovered that true engineering involves more than just coding‚Äîit's about architecting solutions that resonate with users. I faced challenges in communication and storytelling, which drove me to pursue a master‚Äôs degree in Data Analytics to refine these skills.

Today, I combine my technical expertise with a relentless desire to innovate. I embrace failures as stepping stones to growth and believe in the power of collaboration and creativity. 
Let‚Äôs connect and explore how we can turn ideas into impactful solutions together!
